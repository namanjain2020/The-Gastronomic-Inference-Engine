# The-Gastronomic-Inference-Engine

ML-based web application to review dishes of a restaurant. Users can select dishes and submit reviews. The reviews are passed through a machine learning model to identify sentiment - positive, neutral, or negative. Dish Name, Review and Sentiment Label are pushed to a Google Sheet which is further connected to Google Looker Studio for visualization.
